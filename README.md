# Misc Java 8 Solutions

This is a compilation of many java challenges given to me via interview or online tests.  It has a few hundred tests of different types like multi-threading, Java 8 Streams/Lambda Expressions, inheritance, complex logic, etc.  I've been given many white board questions during interviews and I always like to code them when I get home to see how close I was.  I.e., FizzBuzz was one of my first which I perfected in this code in a few different ways.  This also has many Hackrank exercises that I worked on over the years as well.

Warning: code isn't pretty since it was geared toward getting things done quickly and not presenting to anyone.
